# Brotato-Patamods
A mod collection of every character, item, weapon or challenge I've made.

Disclaimer: Some of these characters won't be well balanced and could be considered busted, especially as I'm not one to nerf characters after I've published them if I can help it. If you're looking for characters balanced around the base game's difficulty, this mod probably isn't for you.
